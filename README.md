# Iowa Melee Discord Events
Automated Discord event scheduling for the Iowa Melee server

Even though Discord has an awesome feature to schedule events manually, there is no configuration for recurring events. This repo attempts to automate this process for the weekly tournaments of Iowa Melee.

Uses [Rapptz/discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) extensively.
